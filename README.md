## 4 Ways to Create Objects in JavaScript

1. **Object Literals (`{}`)**

   - Simple and straightforward.
   - Each object must be manually defined, leading to repetitive code for similar objects.

2. **Constructor Functions**

   - Acts as a blueprint for creating multiple similar objects.
   - Reduces redundancy, improves readability and maintainability.
   - Fewer lines of code compared to object literals.

3. **Factory Functions**

   - Functions that return new objects.
   - No `new` keyword required.
   - Simple, flexible, and concise way to create objects.

4. **ES6 Classes**
   - Provides a modern syntax for object blueprints, similar to constructor functions.
   - Supports object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and encapsulation.
   - Cleaner and more powerful for complex structures.
